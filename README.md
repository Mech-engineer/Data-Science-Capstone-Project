# AI Based Business Lovation Selector for City of Toornto

This is a personal project that I worked on along with University to help some friends in selecting the best neightbourhood for opening their sports equipment shop.

# Implementation explained:
## Data Collection
# Neighbourhood Information
- I utlized web scrapping to get the information of Toronto Neighbourhoods from wikipedia

# City Demographic Data
- City of toronto opensource data provides information on demographic data in different neighbourhood of the regions

# Local Business Data

- Foursquare API was utilized to help gain information on local businesses in different neighbourhood.

# Data Processing, visualization

Different python libraries such as pandas, numpy, folium, matplotlib were used to clean and process the data for visualizations

# Modelling

For modelling I used unsupervised learning based technique: K-Means clustering to cluster the neighbourhood.

The neighbourhoods with the min amount of compeition was recommended for the business to maximize young athletic demographic that will utilize the shop and help the business maximize profit.
